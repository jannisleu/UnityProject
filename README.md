# Mario Bros like - Unity Project

## What does our game?

Our game is a Super Mario Bros inspiered 2d jump and run but instead of Mario rescuing Peach, Perry the Platypus is on a mission to help the Coxis. As it is our beloved mascot, we wanted to integrate this amazing animal in our game. On his way through three different levels, Perry is confronted with many enemies such as gumbas, small and BIG. Luckily on his way he finds some items hidden in mysterious boxes that help him fight his way through the three levels. The items include Magic Mushrooms, PowerUps, Stars and some beautful flowers that give him extraordinary powers. The Magic Mushroom helps him grow in size, making him less vulnerable and he is getting his signiture hat. The PowerUps give him extra lives and the star makes him invincible. The flowers, however, equip him with the power of shooting either fire (fire flower) or ice (ice flower). If he can reach the end of a level he has to jump on a flag pole to celebrate his success and to get teleported to the next world. However, the mission is not getting easier for Perry the further he gets. The first level seems easy but the ice and the lava world can be a bit tricky. Do not let the Gumbas get you and do not fall from the platforms in order to survive the level!

## Functionalities: 
- Items that can be collected: Starpower, PowerUps, Magic Mushroom, Fire/IceFlower and Coins
- Powers can be lost when being hit by a Gumba 
- Killing enemies with jumping or shooting 
- Items are hidden in Boxes, in order to get them Perry has to jump against the bottom
- Falling of the platform or being killed by a Gumba when being small is resetting the level

## What were our main issues?
The main issue we encountered in our game making journey was the time aspect. Looking back we should have started earlier since there are so many functionalities we could have implemented to make our game even more fun but there was not enough time left. Maybe we will continue working on it afterwards.

However, we also had some technical issues. The shooting aspect of the fire/ice flower brought some issues along. 
Also, displaying the lives and coins at the top of the screen with the UIManager was a bit of a struggle.

## How should you play our game?

The game can be played like Super Mario Bros.

- Running: Arrow Keys
- Jumping: Space Key
- Shooting: E

Enemies can be killed either with jumping on them or with shooting. 

Running into enemies or falling off the platforms is leading to death and restart.

One world is finished when jumping onto the Flag Pole. 

Items or Coins are hidden in the mystery boxes or in some of the bricks.

Items get you super powers or extra lives.

## Additional Information 

Maybe someting we like to emphasize is that we created (or painted) every sprite ourselves to give the game our individual touch.
